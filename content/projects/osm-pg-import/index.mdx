## OSM PG Import

OSM Data Integration Tool is a tool for automated downloading and updating of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data into a local PostgreSQL database. The project utilizes osm2pgsql and Lua scripts to transform OSM data, ensuring the accuracy and uniqueness of geographic information about features like streets and roads.

## Key Features

- **OSM Data Import:** The tool automatically loads data from OSM PBF files into a PostgreSQL database using osm2pgsql.
- **Data Processing and Transformation:** Data is filtered and transformed using Lua scripts, including the removal of unnecessary elements and normalization of street names.
- **Uniqueness Management:** A system of unique identifiers is used to prevent data duplication during reloads.
- **Automation of Updates:** Bash scripts provide automation of the data loading sequence and subsequent SQL queries for updating and maintaining the data in a current state.
