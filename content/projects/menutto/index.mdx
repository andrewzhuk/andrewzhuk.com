### **Menutto — The Digital Revolution in HoReCa 🍽️🏨🍸**  

This project is my personal challenge, my passion, and my opportunity **to rethink service in the HoReCa industry**. **Menutto** is not just a QR menu; it’s **a flexible digital system for restaurants, cafés, bars, hotels, ski resorts, spas, and other establishments**, designed to make service **faster, more convenient, and more profitable**.  

### **Why Menutto?**  

It all started with a **unique business model** that made me rethink traditional processes in the industry. I have seen **interesting implementations** in different countries, but they all had **serious limitations**:  
- They **operate only in local markets**.  
- Their **functionality is limited** to basic QR menus.  
- They **lack flexibility and control for businesses**.  

*"What if I could create a system that combines the best of existing solutions while eliminating their weaknesses?"*  

This is how the idea for **Menutto** was born—a **next-generation platform** that will help HoReCa **automate service, enhance customer loyalty, and boost revenue**.  

### **What Makes Menutto Unique?**  

- **Next-Level QR Menu** 📲 – Guests simply scan a code and access **an interactive menu** where they can place orders, customize dishes, and add special requests.  
- **Table, Room, and Lounge Reservations** 🏨 – Suitable not just for restaurants but also for **hotels, ski resorts, beach clubs, spas, and private lounge areas**, where seamless booking is essential.  
- **Automated Ordering** 🍽️ – Orders go directly to the kitchen **without delays or mistakes**, making staff more efficient and improving customer experience.  
- **Seamless Payments** 💳 – Guests can pay using **Apple Pay, Google Pay, credit cards, or even cryptocurrency** directly from their smartphones.  
- **Private Feedback System** ⭐ – Guests can **leave direct feedback for business owners**, helping improve service **without public negative reviews**.  
- **Flexible Loyalty Programs** 🎁 – Personalized offers, discounts, and bonuses that businesses can tailor to each guest.  

### **What’s Next?**  

**Menutto is still in development**, but the roadmap is ambitious:  

- **Mobile App** 📱 – To provide maximum convenience for both guests and businesses.  
- **Advanced Analytics** 📊 – Insights into orders, customer preferences, and staff efficiency.  
- **Full Hotel & Resort System** 🏨 – Managing reservations, services, payments, and guest interactions.  
- **Food Delivery Integration** 🚀 – Enabling restaurants and cafés to connect with delivery services.  
- **Multi-Currency & Crypto Payments** 💰 – Making international transactions seamless.  
- **AI-Powered Recommendations** 🤖 – Personalized suggestions and demand forecasting.  
- **Integrations with CRM, ERP, and POS Systems** 🔗 – Helping businesses manage their operations effortlessly.  

### **Menutto is not just a QR menu. It’s a digital platform that makes HoReCa smarter.**
