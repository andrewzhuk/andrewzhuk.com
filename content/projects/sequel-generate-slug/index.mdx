## Sequel Generate Slug: Multilingual URL Slug Generation for Your Sequel Models

## Hello fellow Rubyists! üöÄ

Today I‚Äôm excited to share my new open-source contribution to the Ruby ecosystem: the Sequel Generate Slug plugin. It solves a common yet critical task‚Äîautomatically generating human-readable URL slugs for your Sequel models‚Äîwith a focus on multilingual support and uniqueness.

### Why Did I Create This Plugin?

As a Sequel enthusiast and Ruby lover, I‚Äôve always found a lack of simple, flexible solutions for generating slugs that support Cyrillic, hieroglyphs, and other languages. Existing options either required awkward workarounds or were limited to Latin characters. I wanted to build a tool that:

- Works out of the box with any language üåç
- Integrates into Sequel models with just one line of code
- Remains lightweight and transparent in its behavior

### Key Features

```ruby
class Post < Sequel::Model
  plugin :generate_slug, source: :title, destination: :slug
end
```

- **Automation Without Magic**
  Simply specify a source column (e.g., title), and the plugin generates a slug into the target field (:slug by default). When the title updates, the slug refreshes automatically.

- **Multilingual by Design**
  Use any language‚Äîthe plugin handles Unicode seamlessly, converting characters into URL-friendly formats:

```ruby
post.title = "–î–æ–±—Ä–æ–≥–æ –≤–µ—á–æ—Ä–∞ –º–∏ –∑ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏" # => slug: "dobrogho-viechora-mi-z-ukrayini"
post.title = "A quoi ressemble le texte en fran√ßais avec ce plugin?" # => slug: "a-quoi-ressemble-le-texte-en-francais-avec-ce-plugin"
```

- **Guaranteed Uniqueness**
  If a slug conflicts, it‚Äôs appended with a numeric suffix (e.g., post-title-2). Uniqueness checks can even scope to additional columns (e.g., identifier) of the post.

<Tip type="info">
  Take a look at the length of the full URL for SEO purposes is 100 - 120 characters.
</Tip>

```ruby
post = Post.create(title: 'Hello World', identifier: 'abcdef')
post.slug # => 'hello-world'

post = Post.create(title: 'Hello World', identifier: 'abcdef')
post.slug # => 'hello-world-abcdef'

post = Post.create(title: 'Hello World', identifier: 'abcdef')
post.slug # => 'hello-world-abcdef-1'
```

### Who Is This For?

- Multilingual projects (blogs, e-commerce, SaaS platforms)
- Sequel-based microservices (Roda, Sinatra, or standalone)
- Developers who value simplicity and clean code

The plugin is already powering several production projects and is available on GitHub under the MIT license. I welcome your pull requests, bug reports, and ideas!
