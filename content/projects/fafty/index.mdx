## Fafty NFT Marketplace

Today I would like to talk about a project that has become not just a passion, but a true technological challenge for me — Fafty: an NFT marketplace for video content built on the Internet Computer blockchain (DFINITY). I am especially proud that our bold idea received strong support — a grant from the DFINITY Foundation! This recognition not only confirms Fafty's potential but also opens up new opportunities for further development and innovation.

## Why Fafty?

In the world of crypto technologies, there are plenty of NFT marketplaces focused on static art, yet video as a medium has been undervalued. Fafty addresses this issue by offering:

- **Video-first approach:** The platform allows for uploading, processing, and minting video content as NFTs with support for MP4, MOV, and WebM formats, along with the capability to handle 4K video. This approach takes media monetization to a whole new level.

- **Intuitive interface:** We have created a familiar and user-friendly environment reminiscent of YouTube, where users can easily upload videos, add metadata, and transform them into NFTs in just a few clicks. This greatly simplifies the process for both creators and collectors.

- **Collaborative filtering:** With advanced algorithms, the platform analyzes user activities—views, likes, tags—and based on this data, offers relevant content, helping to identify trends even before they become widespread.

- **Hybrid architecture:** Fafty's technical foundation combines proven technologies with innovative solutions. Part of the server-side logic is implemented in Ruby to rapidly launch the MVP, while the gradual transition to canisters within the ICP ecosystem ensures high scalability and a reliable decentralized infrastructure.

## DFINITY Foundation Grant — The Key to Success

Receiving a grant from the DFINITY Foundation was a pivotal moment in Fafty's development. It was not just financial support but a clear vote of confidence in our idea and technological approach. The grant allowed us to accelerate development, test cutting-edge features, and make the platform as user-friendly as possible. This endorsement has solidified our confidence in the project's future and its potential for continued growth.

## Conclusion

Fafty is not merely an NFT marketplace; it is a comprehensive solution that combines a video platform with a media hub for Web3. The grant from the DFINITY Foundation underscores that our idea resonates with the professional community and represents a significant step forward in the evolution of digital art. We look to the future with optimism, continuing to implement innovative technologies and expanding opportunities for creators and collectors.
